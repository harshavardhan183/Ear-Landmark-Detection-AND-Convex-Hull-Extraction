# Ear-Landmark-Detection-AND-Convex-Hull-Extraction
There are 55 landmarks on human ear which help identifying the person. This model has 500 training images, 105 test images and corresponding landmarks focused on right ear. there are 2 models one which is trained with 500 test images in a single orientation and one with 3000 images in 6 different orientations.one can upload multiple test images at the same time in the folder and get the output for all different input images simultaneously. Before that, download the data folder from the link below. You can see names of the files & folders are compatible with the functions.

Original data belongs to [this source](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/ibug-ears/) (check out Collection A). names are modified according to our convience as it is easier while writing the code. The data that is compatible with the model can be accessed from [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/c8hizptl60lfogh/AADQN-kkuzkiP3ZcREQRxERsa?dl=0).
